Hi <%= @first_name %>,
You've been assigned a new tribe member! This person will report to you and you shall mentor them just as your team lead has mentored you.

His name is <%= @new_member_first_name %> <%= @new_member_last_name %>. You can reach him at <%= @new_member_email %>. Reach out to him as soon as possible.

Make sure you practice patience with a new member. Be inviting and be nice!

In the first week it may be worth going through the tools if they already haven't. Otherwise spend the first week to get to know them. Assign the first set of homework in this initial meeting.

Once you have two people you are mentoring have a "staff" meeting where all of you come together during the weekend to discuss life and Christ principles.

Thanks and onward!
Raj
